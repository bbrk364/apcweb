### README ###
apcweb is a python based web application I wrote to control an APC PDU (power strip) [ap9210] programmatically.

The power_snmp.py file will allow command line control of the pdu
or you can import it and make calls with your own application.

! apcweb.conf is a hard link to a file in the apache configuration directory !

###
Requires:
* python (built on 2.7)
* flask
* pysnmp (and its requirements)
* apache 2 (wsgi module probably needs turned on)
= built and tested on ubuntu 12.01 LTS. libraries and applications installed
= via apt-get
